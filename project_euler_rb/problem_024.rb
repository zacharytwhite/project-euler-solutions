# A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. 
# For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
# If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. 
# The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

# 012   021   102   120   201   210

# What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?


arr = %w{ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 }

puts arr.permutation(10).to_a[999_999].join


# Complete!
# Answer = 2783915460
